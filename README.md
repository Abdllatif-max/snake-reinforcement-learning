The goal is to train an AI agent to play Snake efficiently by learning optimal movement strategies through trial and error. And it did.
A Snake game enhanced by Reinforcement Learning using Deep Q-Networks (DQN).
Our goal is to train an AI agent to master Snake by learning optimal movement strategies through trial and error—and it succeeded.

In this document, we'll cover the key aspects of the project, including setup, training, and improvements. You can download and run the AI-powered Snake on your computer and even enhance its capabilities further.

Currently, our trained model achieves up to 300 survival steps in a 15x15 grid environment.
